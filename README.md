# Create 加油 ("jiā yóu") Events

Google Apps Script for creating events on only certain days (e.g., on only "J Day's"). Modify as needed.

## Getting Started

1. Go to [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/), and create a new project.
2. Copy and paste [the script](./Code.gs) into the editor.
3. Modify the letter day. (By default, it is "J Day." Specifically, `myQuery = "J Day";`)
4. Modify the events' title, description, start time, and end time. (By default, events are titled "New Meeting," are described as "Agenda," start at 10am, and end at 11am.)
5. Save and run the script. (Requires authorization.)
