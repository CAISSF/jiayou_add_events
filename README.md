# Create 加油 ("jiā yóu") Events

Google Apps Script for creating events on only certain days (e.g., on only "J Day's"). Modify as needed.

## Getting Started

1. Go to [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/), and create a new project.
2. Copy and paste [the script](./Code.gs) into the editor.
3. Modify the letter day. (By default, it is "J Day." Specifically, `query = "J Day"`.)
4. On the bottom, modify the events' start time, end time, title, and description. (By default, the events start at 10am, end at 11am, are titled "New Meeting," and are described as "Agenda.")
5. Save and run the script. (Requires authorization.)
